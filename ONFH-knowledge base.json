Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with different diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate population total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at inherently higher risk from exposure, because of both organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the long latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for pediatric examinations are lower as compared with those specified for adults (see Table 2). Additional information regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction document [53]."

The number of participants in a Delphi panel has usually been between 15 and 30 because a larger sample size (beyond 30) has rarely been found to improve the results [25]. Thirty experts, including 9 ARCO board members, were invited to the Delphi panel. Among the 30 invitees, one, who had retired from academic activity, declined the invitation. The remaining 29 experts accepted the invitation and participated in the Delphi procedure. The elected participants had a mean of 19 years (range, 11 - 32) of clinical and/or research experience on osteonecrosis (Table 1).",

            "Modified Delphi Procedure": "The ARCO task force initially raised 3 issues: whether the panel members use the ARCO classification system in their clinical practice and research and if no why not; what are the problems in the current ARCO classification system; and how to revise the system. In the first survey, the panel members were asked to answer 2 open-ended questions about the aforementioned 3 issues. Replies to the first survey were analyzed to determine whether consensus was reached or not. In the second to fourth rounds, the panel members were asked to answer the revised questionnaires on the issues on which the panel members did not reach consensus in the previous round. The rounds were continued until final consensus was obtained. Each round lasted 2 weeks with a 2-week gap for the analysis and controlled feedback. Thus, each participant was informed of anonymized other responses as a simple tabulated descriptive summary. This ensured that all participants contributed to the discussion.",
            "Cut-Off Point for Consensus": "The content validity ratio (CVR) [28] in which the linear transformation of a proportional level of agreement on how many experts within a panel rate an item essential was used. It represents the proportion of panel participants who rate an item as essential. The CVR was calculated according to the following formula, using the total number of experts (N) and the number who rated the object as essential (E): CVR =[(E-(N / 2)) /(N / 2)]. In the case of 29 responders, the cut-off value of CVR was 0.379, which means that 20 is the minimum panel number to reach a consensus [29]. Concerning queries with rates, we defined that a consensus was reached when more than 70% of panel members scored a 4 or 5 rating on a 5-point scale [30].",
            "Data Synthesis and Analysis": "Data from each Delphi round were extracted from the online survey database and were anonymously reported back to all panel members. Opinions or rationales provided by panel members were also anonymously circulated. The open-ended responses in the first round were integrated, categorized, and described in terms of frequency and percentages. In the second and third rounds, the answers were collected, and the percentage and CVR were calculated for each answer. In the fourth round, the proportion of the panel who rated 4 or more on a 5-point scale was computed for each question.",

        ],
        "PATIENTS AND METHODS": {
            "METHODS": "We have used the new method to evaluate over 1000 hips affected with AVN, employing good-quality anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs, and, for preradiographic stages, technetium bone scans and MRI. We have also used the Harris rating system for separate clinical evaluation. Seven stages ofinvolvement are identifed(Table ).After staging,the extent of involvement of the femoralhead and acetabulum is measured or estimated and recor-ded as mild (A). moderate (B).or severe (C)(Table ll). For routine clinical use,estimation is quick and easy: forresearch projects and publications extent should be measured and expressed in percentages or millimetres, as descri.bed later. Neither part of the system is arbitrary, and bothstage and extent correlate closely with the sequence ofpathological events which takes place in AVN.",
            "Stage":{
                "Stage 0": {
                    "Paragraph 1": "Stage 0 is suspicion of AVN although the diagnosis cannot be confirmed. Plain radiographs are normal; MRI and bone scans are either normal or non - diagnostic (Figs I and 2).",
                    "Paragraph 2": "There is a definite lag between the vascular insult and the appearance of imaging abnormalities. When vascular compromise is incomplete and the involved area is small, this may escape detection by current imaging methods, but as new and more sensitive methods are developed, earlier diagnosis will be possible. smaller lesions will be detected, and the diagnosis as stage 0 may be confirmed. This stage allows for technological advances in diagnosis and will extend the useful life of the staging system.",
                    "Paragraph 3": "At present, we include in stage 0 patients with known risk factors and abnormal but not diagnostic MRI or bone scans, and also patients with hip pain but normal imaging. AVN is often already present in the opposite hip, and careful review and repeated imaging are necessary. Later changes may confirm the diagnosis, but no changes, or reversion to normal, may make it impossible at present to determine whether the patient had minimal AVN with spontaneous resolution, or some other condition. Biopsy or other invasive methods is rarely justified, and would often be negative or equivocal at this stage."
                },
                "Stage I": "In this stage plain radiographs are within normal limits, but either the MRI or the technetium scan or both indicates AVN. These methods can show injury and death of marrow and bone cells with resultant changes in and around the area of involvement, before they are visible radiologically (Mitchell et al 1986, 1987, 1989) (Figs 3, 4 and 5).",
                "Stage II": "Radiographs show definite changes consistent with AVN, such as alternating areas of radiolucency and sclerosis, at times demarcated from normal bone by a sclerotic border (Figs 6 and 7). This demarcation signifies repair; the sclerotic appearance is due to new, living bone laid down on old, dead trabecula. Areas of radiolucency represent bone resorption; they are often filled with fibrous or granulation tissue, amorphous debris, and even cartilage. Other authors have reported generalised osteopenia as an early finding in AVN, but we have seen this only rarely.",
                "Stage III": "This is defined by the appearance of a radiolucent crescent sign just beneath the subchondral end plate of the femoral head, indicating collapse of cancellous trabecula without flattening of the articular surface (Figs 8 and 9). The crescent sign does not always develop during progressive involvement and may often be visible only on the anteroposterior or the lateral film. Only a small percentage of hips fit the criteria for stage III, but we consider that this should not be combined with the more advanced finding of flattening of the femoral head. In stage III, the femoral head remains spherical, and it is therefore theoretically possible to preserve its shape by bone grafting or other procedures.",
                "Stage IV": {
                    "Paragraph 1": "In this stage there is definite flattening of the articular surface, seen on either the AP or the lateral radiograph. The collapse is usually in the anterolateral or superior weight - bearing segments of the femoral head (Figs I 0 and 1 1). Small amounts of collapse may not show up on plain radiographs, but may be detected by either laminograms or CT. We rarely use these methods, but they should be considered when plain films show no evidence of collapse and the patient experiences more than the anticipated amount of pain and disability. The acetabulum appears radiologically normal at this stage, but observations at operations confirm that there is often some degeneration in the acetabular articular cartilage (Steinberg, Corces and Fallon 1989).",
                    "Paragraph 2": "Stage IV has serious prognostic and therapeutic implications because the changes are irreversible. Prophylactic treatment may be indicated in early stage - IV lesions with no significant pain or disability, but the results are often disappointing, and many of these patients will need only symptomatic treatment until arthroplasty is indicated."
                },
                "Stage V": {
                    "Paragraph 1": "In this stage there is clear radiological evidence of acetabular involvement. In our experience this almost always follows flattening of the femoral head and is a secondary degenerative process, not due to primary avascularity of pelvic bone. The earliest change is joint - line narrowing, due to degenerative changes of the articular cartilage of the acetabulum. Later, there are areas of ‘cyst’ formation and sclerosis above the acetabulum with small marginal osteophytes (Figs 12 and 13).",
                    "Paragraph 2": "This transition from stage IV to stage V has some therapeutic importance, since replacement of the femoral head may be considered in stage IV, but total hip replacement is required once there is definite acetabular involvement."
                },
                "Stage VI": "This describes advanced degenerative changes with virtually complete obliteration of the joint line. Other systems have combined our stages V and VI, but we have seen a small number of patients with changes that can clearly be distinguished from stage V and deserve a separate staging (Figs 14 and 15)"

            "Paragraph 1":"We evaluated our system for reproducibility of measurement, and for the identification and measurement of changes in comparison with other non-quantitative methods of staging. An essential feature of our system is the measurement of the size of lesions in the early stages. We reviewed MRI studies of ten stage-I hips with from 2.8% to 52.3% involvement on a SUN work station using an image-analysis software package (ANALYZE) to calculate the relative volume of the necrotic lesion as a percentage of the entire femoral head. The ten hips were evaluated by three independent observers who each made three sets of measurements on each case, providing 90 separate determinations. The resultant data were analysed by a biostatistician.",
            "Paragraph 2": "There was relatively little variation in repeated measurements made by the same observer, but more variability between observers. For this, the reliability coefficient for femoral head measurement was 89.5%, for lesion measurement 87.0%, and for the ratio of lesion to the whole head 81.9%. These correlations are high for measurements of this type and indicate that our method of evaluation is reliable enough to be clinically useful.",
            "Paragraph 3": "We also studied 73 hips with early AVN in stages I and II, to evaluate the effect of lesion size on outcome after core decompression and bone grafting (Steinberg et al 1992) and the results are shown in Table III. These confirm a clear correlation between lesion size and outcome as measured by radiological progression, clinical improvement, and the need for hip replacement, but there were no significant differences between stages I and II. This indicates that before collapse of the femoral head, lesion size rather than stage may be the most important determinant of clinical outcome.",
            "Paragraph 4": "We then compared calculations of lesion size made by MRI with those made from plain radiographs for 14 stage-II hips. For small lesions on MRI (<15%; grade A) radiographs showed a mean volume 8% larger than that on MRI. For large lesions 30% grade C) radiographs showed a mean volume smaller. Considering that MRI and radiography record different biophysical phenomena and use different techniques to calculate size, these measurements were surprisingly close. Variability was, of course, greater when size was simply estimated rather than measured.",
            "Paragraph 5": "We then compared the reliability of the system with that of the non-quantitative staging described by Ficat and Arlet (1980) and Ficat (1985), which is the method most widely used. Our staging and grading were generally more reliable because there was less ambiguity in distinguishing between stages, and the subjective evidence of patients’ symptoms was eliminated. Most importantly, our method recorded progression of lesions in extent of involvement which was missed when sizes were not measured; by the older method progression was only indicated when it was great enough to cause a change from one stage to the next (Fig. 19).",
            "Paragraph 6": "We confirmed this by evaluating 115 hips with AVN independently on both our system and the Ficat system. We found radiographic progression by measurement in 74% but this could be identified in only 50% using the Ficat method. For 45 hips in stage IV, with collapse of the femoral head, method showed deterioration in 66%, while the Ficat system indicated progression in only 15%."

        "Methods":{
            "ARCO Task Force":"The ARCO task force was set up to prepare the Delphi survey and consisted of 7 members: 4 orthopedic surgeons,1 expert researcher on bone circulation/osteonecrosis, 1 rheumatologist, and 1 statistician/methodologist. The task force performed a search of PubMed, using the key search terms “osteonecrosis,” “avascular necrosis,” “aseptic necrosis,” “glucocorticoid,” and “steroid” for entries from January 1, 1960 to May 31, 2017. The search was restricted to human studies in the greater than 18 years’ age group. The task force reviewed 75 citations relevant to GA-ONFH and selected 23 key literatures (Supplementary 1). Through the comprehensive literature review, the task force raised 4 issues to develop novel etiologic classification criteria of GA-ONFH: (1) whether experts necessitate classification criteria of GA-ONFH; (2) minimal dosage of glucocorticoids that need to have been administered to the patients; (3) the latent period after exposure to glucocorticoid, when a diagnosis of ONFH can be made; and (4) how to classify ONFH patients, who have other risk factor(s) besides glucocorticoid.",
            "Expert Panel Members": "In June 2017, the task force initially invited 30 experts because the sample size of a panel has usually been recommended to 15 - 30 participants in the Delphi study design and a larger sample size (beyond 30) has rarely been found to improve the results [12]. ARCO made the panel qualifications for the Delphi study: college faculty, more than 10 years of clinical and/or research experience, and 3 or more publications on bone circulation/osteonecrosis, for a homogeneous panel based on the knowledge on ONFH and level of clinical or research experience. Among the 30 experts, 1 declined the invitation and 1 did not reply to the invitation. The remaining 28 experts on osteonecrosis/bone circulation participated in the Delphi procedure. The panel members had a mean of approximately 18 years of clinical and/or research experience.",
            "The Modified Delphi Procedure": "The Delphi technique is a widely accepted method for achieving convergence of expert opinions. The following features characterize the procedures: anonymity, iteration, and controlled feedback. Anonymity allows participants to express their opinions freely without being pressured by other participants, and permits them to change their opinion if necessary, thus helping participants consider the issues based on merits alone. In this study, anonymity was achieved by an Internet survey. Iteration is achieved by presenting questionnaires several times over a number of rounds, thereby allowing participants to change their opinions. Controlled feedback takes place between rounds: each participant learns of the other participants’ opinions. Participants often receive this feedback as a simple statistical summary of responses, although arguments may present. This ensures that all the participants contribute to the discussion.",
            "Cut-Off Point for Consensus": "The content validity ratio (CVR) is a linear transformation of a proportional level of agreement [13]. The main benefit of CVR is to readily indicate whether the level of agreement among panel members exceeds 50%. It represents the proportion of panel participants, who rate an item as essential, and is calculated as follows: We had 28 panel members; therefore, the cut-off value of CVR was 0.357, which means 19 is a minimum number of panels required to reach a consensus in each questionnaire.",
            "Data Synthesis and Analysis": "Data from all Delphi rounds were extracted from the online survey database to an Excel V.20.0 spreadsheet, and anonymously reported as feedback to each panelist. Qualitative data (ie, expert answers and justifications) were analyzed by content analysis and discussed by the task force. In the first open-ended round, the replies were integrated and classified according to the frequency analysis. In the second and further rounds consisting of multiple choice questions, the percentage and CVR of answers in each item were calculated."

The task force performed a search of PubMed, using the key search terms “osteonecrosis,” “avascular necrosis,” “aseptic necrosis,” and “alcohol” for entries from January 1, 1960, to May 31, 2017. A total of 50 reports on AA-ONFH were identified and reviewed. The task force selected 6 key studies which investigated the risk of ONFH and alcohol intake including cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies (Supplementary 1). Through the comprehensive literature review, the task force raised 4 issues to develop novel etiologic classification criteria of AA-ONFH: (1) whether panelists necessitated classification criteria for AA-ONFH; (2) the minimal dose of alcohol intake; (3) the latent period after alcohol intake of such dose, when a diagnosis of ONFH should be made; and (4) how to classify ONFH patients who have other risk factor(s) than alcohol.",
                "Paragraph 2": "In June of 2017, the task force initially invited 30 experts and ARCO made the panel qualifications for the Delphi study: college faculty, more than 10 years of clinical and/or research experience, and 3 or more publications on bone circulation/osteonecrosis. Among the 30 experts, one declined the invitation and one did not reply to the invitation. The remaining 28 experts on osteonecrosis/ bone circulation participated in the Delphi procedure. The panel members had a mean of approximately 18 years of clinical and/or research experience."

            "The Modified delphi Procedure": "The modified Delphi technique is a means of reaching a group consensus through multiple rounds of anonymous feedback and iterations and, especially, is valuable in situations where imprecise or contradictory opinions exist [32]. The details of our Delphi method are referred to the Part 1: GA-ONFH. Briefly, in the first round, the panel members were asked to answer 4 open-ended questions on the above-mentioned issues. In the second and further rounds, the panel members were asked to answer the revised questionnaires on the issues, on which consensus was not reached in the previous round. Between survey rounds, the response summary of the previous round was presented as anonymous feedback. In our study, 3 rounds were employed until final consensus was obtained on the 4 issues of AA-ONFH. A consensus was determined based on a content validity ratio of 0.357 or greater which means that 19 is a minimum number required to reach a consensus in each questionnaire among 28 panels [33]."

        "General Introduction": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH), previously also called ischaemic necrosis of the femoral head, mainly affects younger patients. An evidence-based standardized treatment regimen is very important. Expert Advice on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Osteonecrosis of the “Femoral Head (2007 version) [1]”, “Chinese Experts' Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head in Adults (2012 version) [2]”, and “Chinese Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Femoral Head Necrosis in Adults (2016 version) [3]” were formulated based on evidence-based medicine and the opinion of a large number of professional specialists and orthopaedists in the discipline. These guidelines have promoted the standardization of classification and improvement in the diagnosis and selection of treatment procedures for patients with ONFH. However, there are still deficiencies in the understanding of staging and the choice of diagnostic and treatment methods. In May 2019, based on the 2016 version guideline [3], professional specialists, scholars, and orthopaedists from Europe, Asia, America, and China jointly develop new guidelines for further standardized and effective clinical diagnosis and treatment of adults with ONFH. New advances in the epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology, imaging, diagnosis, and treatment of ONFH have been renewed in this revision.",
        "Inclusion Criteria of the References": "An extensive literature search was conducted based on the Medline database at the PubMed and China Knowledge Resource Integrated database. Considering an advanced established guideline based on the 2016 version, the recent studies up to November 2019 were included, and the studies lacking evidence-based medicine support, i.e., published in non-journal citation reports (JCR) journals, were excluded in the current guideline version.",
        "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) Overview": {
            "Definition" : "ONFH is a disease in which local death of osteocytes and the component of the bone marrow occurs owing to venous stasis or arterial blood supply damage or interruption in the femoral head; the subsequent repair process attempts to heal the necrotic area, but structural deterioration and collapse of the femoral head causes pain and dysfunction of the hip joint [2, 4–11].",
            "Epidemiology": "To date, there is no epidemiological report on ONFH worldwide, although some countries have screened their osteonecrosis population. An estimated 20,000 new cases of osteonecrosis are diagnosed in the United States each year, and the cumulative number of patients with ONFH is 300,000 to 600,000 [12]. In recent years, approximately 12,000–24,000 new cases of osteonecrosis were diagnosed in Japan. In South Korea, the prevalence rate was 20.53 per 100,000 people in 2002; however, in 2006, this number reached 37.96, and the estimated number of new cases reached 14,103 per year on average [13]. The first large-scale epidemiological survey of nontraumatic osteonecrosis in China showed that the estimated cumulative number of patients with nontraumatic ONFH reached 8.12 million; the prevalence rate was significantly higher in men (1.02%) than in women (0.51%); the prevalence rate was higher in northern residents (0.85%) than in southern residents (0.61%) and higher in urban residents than in rural residents. Glucocorticoids, alcohol, high blood lipid level, obesity, certain occupations (e.g., diving), smoking, and diabetes are all high-risk factors for nontraumatic osteonecrosis [14,15].",
            "Aetiology and high-risk populations": "ONFH can be divided into two major categories: traumatic and nontraumatic. The main aetiological factors for traumatic ONFH include femoral head and neck fracture, acetabular fracture, hip dislocation, and severe hip sprain or contusion (no fracture, with intraarticular haematoma) [16–21]. The main causes of nontraumatic ONFH in China are use of corticosteroids, chronic alcohol overconsumption, decompression sickness, haemoglobin diseases (sickle cell anaemia, sickle cell-haemoglobin C disease, thalassaemia, sickle cell trait, and so on), autoimmune diseases, and idiopathic diseases [6,15,22–25]. Smoking and obesity increase the risk of ONFH [26,27] and are considered to be correlated with ONFH [28–30]"
        },
        "Diagnostic criteria": {
            "Clinical features": "Pain is primarily localized in the hip, buttock, or groin area, occasionally accompanied by knee pain and limited hip internal rotation. Patients often have a history of hip trauma, corticosteroid usage, or alcoholism or have a high-risk occupational history, such as being a diver [6,14,15,23].",
            "Magnetic resonance imaging": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination has a high sensitivity for ONFH [31–34], demonstrated as a limited subchondral linear-shaped low signal intensity in T1-weighted images (T1WIs) or a “double-line sign” in T2-weighted images (T2WIs) [32,35,36].",
            "X-ray imaging": "Anteroposterior and frog-leg positioning are the basic X-ray positions used for diagnosis of ONFH, and the X-ray manifestations are typically osteosclerosis, cystic change, and a “crescent sign” [37] in earlier stages. After collapse, there is a loss of sphericity of the femoral head and degenerative arthritis in the late stages.",
            "Computed tomography scanning": "Computed tomography (CT) scanning usually reveals zones of osteosclerosis surrounding the necrotic bone and repaired bone or shows subchondral bone fracture [38–40].",
            "Radionuclide examination": "An acute-phase bone scan of the femoral head (99Tcm-MDP (Methylene Diphosphonate),99Tcm-DPD (Dicarboxypropane Diphosphonate), and so on) can reveal cold areas; scanning during the necrosis repair period demonstrates a cold area in the middle of a hot area, in other words a “donut-like” change (cold in hot) [41]. Radionuclide examination has less specificity than MRI, but has the advantage to detect multifocal osteonecrosis (other sites than the hip). Single-photon emission computed tomography may increase the sensitivity of radionuclide examination for diagnosis of ONFH [42,43]. Positron emission tomography may detect signs of ONFH earlier than MRI and single-photon emission computed tomography and can predict progression of ONFH [44].",
            "Bone biopsy and pathological manifestations": [
                "Pathological morphology is divided into three phases: the early phase of blood supply changes, the midphase of blood supply changes, and the late phase of blood supply changes. During the early phase of blood supply changes, the blood supply to the epiphysis is blocked; some cells show signs of necrosis, the proportion of empty lacunae in trabecular bone is more than 50%, a number of adjacent trabecular bones are involved, and a portion of the bone marrow is necrotic [45]. Stimulated by ONFH risk factors, bone marrow stem cells gradually differentiated into hypertrophic fat cells. The diameter of the marrow fat cells increases by more than 10-μm hypertrophy of the fat cell [46]. Small veins exhibit thrombosis, larger veins are dilated, venous sinuses are congested, the interstitial space shows oedema, and venous stasis and high pressure in the bone develops owing to poor venous return in digital subtraction angiography (DSA).",
                "During the midphase of blood supply changes, the venous thrombosis is further aggravated, and arteriovenous stenosis or arterial thrombosis occurs, resulting in insufficient blood supply to the arterial system and subsequent entry into an arterial ischaemic state. In this phase, subchondral bone fracture is observed, the necrotic area is enlarged, local cystic change is visible, part of the femoral head area is collapsed, necrotic bone tissue enters the main repair stage, and new blood vessels and new fibrotic tissue grow into the necrotic area to form granulation tissue.",
                "During the late phase of blood supply changes, arterial endothelial hyperplasia occurs, the arterial diameter decreases, and the loss of arterial structure is further aggravated, leading to complete arterial occlusion, which indicates osteoarthritis of the hip joint. Obstruction or interruption of blood flow in the arteries and veins occurs at the beginning of trauma in traumatic ONFH. This ischaemic state is manifested by pathologic and histological changes similar to those that occur in the midphase of blood supply changes which gradually occur and may develop into the late phase of blood supply changes [45]. Biopsy was usually obtained when core decompression was performed using a large-diameter trephine. Actually, when MRI shows typical lesion, biopsy is not necessary."
            ],
            "Digital subtraction angiography": "ONFH may manifest as stasis, damage, and interruption of blood supply to the femoral head, which have important guiding significance for preventing the occurrence of osteonecrosis after femoral neck fracture. In nontraumatic ONFH, venous stasis and blockage of blood return appear in the early phase, arterial ischaemia occurs in the midphase, and arterial occlusion develops in the late phase. After diagnosis of osteonecrosis is confirmed, DSA is recommended for patients undergoing hip preservation surgery to provide a basis for development of a surgical plan.",

However, the CT manifestations of ONFH are osteosclerosis and cystic degeneration, and the primary MRI change is low signal intensity, which can be used for differentiation.",
            "Osteoarthritis secondary to acetabular dysplasia": "X-ray imaging shows incomplete covering of the femoral head, a narrowed or absent joint space, osteosclerosis and cystic degeneration, and similar changes in the corresponding area of the acetabulum, which are easy to differentiate.",
            "Ankylosing spondylitis involving the hip joint": "This condition is common in adolescent men and usually involves both sacroiliac joints. Serum detection of Human Leuc ocyte Antigen (HLA-B27) is positive. X-ray imaging shows that the femoral head remains round and that the joint space narrows, disappears, or even fuses, which is easy to distinguish. Long-term use of corticosteroids in some patients may cause ONFH, in which the femoral head may collapse but not to a serious degree.",
            "Transient osteoporosis or bone marrow oedema syndrome": "The onset of this condition can be observed in young and middle-aged people, and it is a temporary, painful bone marrow oedema. X-ray imaging shows a decrease in bone mass in the head, neck, and even the trochanter of the femur; MRI shows a uniform low signal intensity in T1WIs and high signal intensity in T2WIs, with a range that may reach the femoral neck and the trochanter but with no band-like low signal intensity. The lesion may disappear within 3–12 months [48–50].",
            "Chondroblastoma in the femoral head": "MRI demonstrates flake-shaped high signal intensity in T2WIs. CT scanning shows irregular osteolytic destruction.",
            "Incomplete fracture in subchondral bone": "This is most common in elderly patients older than 60 years who have no obvious history of trauma and manifests as sudden hip pain, inability to walk, and limited joint movement. X-ray imaging shows slight flattening of the upper lateral portion of the femoral head; MRI demonstrates a subchondral low signal intensity line and the surrounding bone marrow oedema in T1WIs and T2WIs, and fat-suppressed T2WIs show a flake-shaped high signal intensity line [51–54]. Meanwhile, it is to be noted that young healthy adults with good bone quality were also found to suffer from subchondral stress fracture (e.g., military recruits during military drills) [55,56].",
            "Pigmented villonodular synovitis": "This condition is common in the knee joints, and hip involvement is rare. Patients with hip involvement are characterized by adolescent-onset, mild to moderate hip pain with limp and mild limitation of joint movement during the early stage and midstage. CT and X-ray imaging show cortical erosion of the femoral head and neck or acetabulum and mild to moderate narrowing of the joint space; MRI shows extensive synovial hypertrophy and an even distribution of low or moderate signal intensity.",
            "Synovial herniation": "This is a benign lesion in which the synovial tissue overgrows and invades into the femoral neck cortex, usually without clinical symptoms.

X-ray examination in the frog-leg position or lateral hip position shows obvious osteophyte formation in the head and neck of the femur and an increase in the angle α. MRI examination shows a flake-shaped, low signal intensity at the femoral head and neck in T1WIs and a large, sheet-shaped bone marrow oedema signal at the femoral head and neck in T2WIs. CT examination shows obvious hyperplasia of the femoral head and neck, an increase in the angle α in the oblique sagittal view, no obvious cystic degeneration in the femoral head, and no bone destruction. Three-dimensional CT reconstruction can clearly reveal anatomical abnormalities or osteophytosis of the femoral head and neck [57–59]."

        "Staging": "The newly released 2019 updated version of Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) staging system is recommended (Table 1). The ARCO staging system was developed by the ARCO committee in 1991 after integration of Ficat staging, Steinberg staging (Table 2) [61], and the staging system of the Japanese Investigation Committee on Osteonecrosis [62]. The 2019 updated version of the ARCO staging system was presented and approved on May 3, 2019, at the 2019 ARCO conference in Dalian, China [60]. ARCO staging is more systematic, comprehensive, and practical than any previous staging method and is of great value in diagnosis and assessment of treatment efficacy and prognosis. In 2015, China developed a Chinese staging system for ONFH (Table 3) [63], which is recommended to be used simultaneously with ARCO staging in clinical practice.",

                "Prevention of traumatic ONFH": "DSA or computed tomography angiography combined with X-ray imaging can be used to evaluate the blood supply in the femoral head and to analyze whether blood vessels are present in the supporting region of the femoral head. When there is no blood supply, exploration and anastomosis of blood vessels in the supporting region can be performed, bone flaps with vascular pedicles can be grafted, and blood supply needs to be protected during internal fixation, while damage to the arterial arch should be avoided.",
                "Prevention of steroid-induced ONFH": "For patients who need hormone therapy during treatment of a disease, vasodilator drugs combined with anticoagulant drugs may be administered to prevent the occurrence of osteonecrosis [65,66].",
                "Prevention of other types of ONFH": "For a population with high-risk factors for osteonecrosis, removal of the aetiologic factors of osteonecrosis can effectively prevent the occurrence of ONFH."

                "overview": "When ONFH progresses rapidly and nonsurgical treatment is not effective, most patients require surgical treatment. Surgical methods can be sorted into two major categories: repair and reconstruction methods that primarily preserve the patient's own femoral head and the hip joint replacement method. Surgeries that preserve the femoral head include core decompression, osteotomy, and (non)vascularized bone transplantation [2,4,6], which are suitable for patients in the early (ARCO 0–1) or midstage (ARCO 2–3 B) of ONFH and with a necrotic volume of more than 15%. If the method is effective, joint replacement can be avoided or delayed.",
                "Core decompression": "This method can be selected when DSA and MRI results suggest that the blood supply demonstrates characteristics of early venous stasis (stage 1–2A ARCO staging). This method has been developed over a long period of time and has beneficial results. At present, it can be divided into core decompression via multiple drilling and core decompression via a thick channel. The difference lies primarily in the diameter of the decompression channel; the channel diameter for multiple drilling is 3, 3.5, or 4 mm [82–85], whereas that of the thick channel is 6 mm or more [86–88]. Core decompression combined with cell transplantation (in vitro culture or concentrated autologous bone marrow containing mononuclear cells) has been administered clinically in qualified medical institutions [89–92].",
                "Nonvascularized transplantation": "The primary methods used include decompression and bone transplantation via the femoral trochanter and bulb decompression and bone grafting via the femoral head and neck [93]. Bone grafting methods include compactbonegraftingandstrutgrafting.Thebonetransplantation materials include autologous cortical bone and cancellous bone, allogeneic bone, and bone substitute materials [94–97].",
                "Osteotomy": "The purpose of an osteotomy is to move the necrotic zone to the non–weight-bearing area of the femoral head. Osteotomy techniques include varus or valgus osteotomy and rotational osteotomy via the femoral trochanter. The choice of the surgical method is based on the principle that the femoral cavity is not modified [98,99].",

                    "Recommend advice": "Surgical techniques involving the peri-hip bone flap with a vascular pedicle are less traumatic, highly effective, and easy to master and are therefore recommended. To enhance mechanical support within the femoral head, application of a peri-hip bone flap with a vascular pedicle can be combined with implantation of a supportive material, which can help avoid collapse of the femoral head after surgery and has demonstrated good short-term to midterm efficacy [108, 109]; however, the long-term effects still need to be determined. In addition, transplantation of a vascularized fibula graft via anastomoses is effective [110–114] and is recommended. The choice of the transplantation method using autologous bone with blood supply is considered based on the comprehensive advantages and disadvantages of each method, the proficiency of the surgeon, and other factors."

Patients with necrosis in the weightbearing area who have no clinical symptoms and a necrotic volume >30  should be actively treated and assessed for blood supply, and physicians should not wait for symptoms to appear. Based on the changes in blood supply, coredecompression or nonsurgical treatments may be applied in combination [123].",
                "ARCO stage 0": "If one side is diagnosed as nontraumatic ONFH, the other side should be highly suspected. Bilateral MRI should be performed. Follow-up every 3–6 months and use of anticoagulation therapy combined with vasodilator drugs are recommended.",

Patients with ARCO stage 2C disease can be treated with (non)vascularized bone graft transplantation (can be combined with supportive materials) [95–97,108,124–126] and osteotomy. Nonsurgical treatments, such as lower limb traction and drug treatment, should be actively performed as auxiliary therapeutic treatments.",

                "ARCO stage 4": "Severe hip function loss or pain appears in this stage, and joint replacement should be selected. If the symptoms are mild and the patient is relatively young (younger than 55 years), joint preservation surgery can be performed. Based on the blood supply changes, the vascularized autologous bone transplantation is recommended, which can be combined with implantation of supportive material. Femoral head preservation surgery typically uses one method or a combination of two or more surgical methods. Nonsurgical treatments should also be included for comprehensive treatment.",
                "Age factor": "Age is another key factor in the choice of treatment options. Young and middle-aged patients are very active, and therefore, a treatment plan that can retain the femoral head without adversely affecting future joint replacement opportunity should be selected. Based on the observed blood supply changes, performing core decompression (stem cell transplantation), transplantation of autologous bone with a blood supply, or transplantation of bone without a blood supply (necrosis range of 15–30%) is recommended. If middle-aged patients are diagnosed with ONFH at an early stage (no collapse), great effort should be made to preserve the femoral head by using core decompression and (non)vascularized bone transplantation. In the middle to late stage, treatment that preserves the femoral head or joint replacement should be chosen considering the patients' subjective wishes and technical conditions. When performing joint replacement, prosthesis selection should fully consider the possibility of secondary revision. For elderly patients, a total hip joint replacement is recommended. For patients older than 75 years, the decision is reached based on factors such as daily activity status, hip bone condition, and prediction of longevity. Total hip joint replacement is recommended."

Simultaneous gait analysis is recommended. Imaging evaluation is performed using X - ray images, and the concentric circle template is used to observe changes in the femoral head morphology, joint space, and acetabulum. Lesion evaluation of ONFH at stage 2 or lower in the Chinese staging system should use MRI data. DSA should be performed for patients undergoing vascularized bone transplantation to evaluate the recovery of blood supply [105].

Even if the necrotic area is small, somecases with the necrotic region existing in the weight-bearingportion progress to collapse. Late development of ONFH onthe opposite side is rare in cases with unilateral ONFH."

                ],
                "Hip osteoarthritis": "One of the causes of secondary osteoarthritis is ONFH; however, it is necessary to clarify the cause of secondary osteoarthritis when it is diagnosed. Bone cysts of hip osteoarthritis are relatively more commonly misdiagnosed as sclerosis of ONFH in radiographic images. MRI findings show that the margin of the bone cyst has a low signal intensity in the T1-weighted image, but the interior region shows a diffuse low signal in the T1-weighted image and a diffuse high signal in the T2-weighted image, which differs from ONFH. Bone scintigraphy does not show “cold in hot” in hip osteoarthritis.",
                "Transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH)": "It is sometimes difficult to differentiate TOH from ONFH because MRI presents an obvious image of widespread bone marrow edema from the head of the femur to its neck. The etiology and pathology of TOH have not been fully elucidated. In TOH, a radiographic image shows bone atrophy from the outside of the femoral head to the femoral neck, and the outline of the femoral head becomes unclear. The typical band-like low-signal region is not recognized. Bone scintigraphy does not show a cold in a hot image but shows a diffuse hot image. Treatment for TOH is conservative therapy because TOH is generally a self-limited disease. Since the prognosis of joint function differs from ONFH, which leads to the collapse of the femoral head, it is important to differentiate it as early as possible to determine the correct treatment strategy.",
                "Subchondral insufficiency fracture (SIF)": "SIF is common among older women and is often based on osteoporosis, but it also occurs in younger people. At the time of onset, the radiographic findings are poor compared to the severity of pain. MRI reveals bone marrow edema in the femoral head and an irregular low-signal region under the articular cartilage in T1-weighted images. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish SIF from the typical band-like low-signal region seen in ONFH. The typical band-like low signal region of the T1-weighted image is usually convex to the distal side in ONFH, while the low signal area is close to the articular cartilage surface and is centrally convex or parallel to the joint surface in SIF.",
                "Rapidly destructive coxopathy (RDC)": [
                    "RDC is a rare disease in which pain occurs in normal hip joints without obvious causes, along with joint degeneration and destruction progress within 6 - 12 months. It is necessary to differentiate from infection, inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis, and Charcot joint. In radiography, the joint space narrows in the initial stage, and the destruction of the femoral head is observed as it progresses. MRI shows bone marrow edema but does not show the band-like low signal region, which is typical of ONFH.",
                    "The JIC for ONFH under the auspices of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare established diagnostic criteria as well as a staging system and a classification system for ONFH and revised it in 2001 [123].",
                    "Steinberg, and the Association Research Circulation Osseous Staging systems have been reported by Ficat and Arlet [130], (ARCO) [132]. Regarding the extent of necrosis, the Steinberg classification [131], ARCO classification [132], JIC classification [123], and modified Kerboul disease classification [133] are widely used. In order to compare treatment results with overseas reports, it is necessary to understand these classifications.",
                    "There are several issues to be considered when applying some type of classification. The Steinberg classification requires special software to measure the volume and time for evaluation [131]. In the case of the modified Kerboul classification, it is unclear which necrotic region should be measured at the joint surface area or the largest necrotic area in the slice view [133]. Conversely, the JIC classification is simple and practical because it is performed by evaluating the central coronal slice [123].",
                    "Regarding the natural course of ONFH, the size and location ofthe necrotic region is important for predicting the prognosis [15] when the progression of ONFH is defned as the progression of stage. In the JIC classification system based on the size and location of the necrotic area on the mid-coronal MRI images, the collapserate of femoral head was as follows: Type A: 0%, Type B:0-29%, Type c1:13-26%, and Type c2:50-86% [113,134,135]. In the Steinberg classification based on necrotic volume, 7% of grade A(less than 15%), 31% of grade B(15-30%), and 33% of grade C(15% or more) were treated with total hip arthroplasty(THA)[136]. Conversely, when the cut-off was set to <190, 191-239°, and<240° in the modifed Kerboul classification based on the necrotic angle in mid-coronal MR images and mid-sagittal image, the cumulative survival rates were 100%, 50%, and 0%, respectively [133]",
                    "However, it has been reported that some cases with the necrotic region existing in the weight-bearing portion progressed to collapse even if it was small [137,138]. There have been no reports that sex, age, BMI, or associated factors were related to the pro-gression of ONFH, Late development of ONFH on the opposite side was rare in cases with unilateral ONFH [113,139]. In a prospective study based on the diagnosis of ONFH by MRI, it has been reportedthat symptoms appear in 6 months to 3 years and progress tocollapse in 1-7 years [134,135](Table 7)."
                ]
            },
            "Preface of treatment": "Once the diagnosis of ONFH is confirmed, it is necessary to decide the treatment. As described in BQ3 - 3, ONFH type classification based on the proportion of the necrotic lesion in the weight - bearing area of the femoral head and the stage classification based on the radiographic findings are useful for treatment decisions. In addition, approximately half of the ONFH cases are associated with systemic steroid administration, and it is necessary to evaluate general conditions carefully as these patients have various comorbidities. Moreover, treatment should be determined in consideration of age, sex, occupation, and social and economic background.",

The literature review team performed systematic searches with the guidance and oversight of a medical research librarian, based on the PICO questions, on September 27, 2021, and later updated on June 19, 2022; in total, 8,283 abstracts were identified. For the purpose of this guideline, our defined population is patients who have radiographically moderate-to-severe OA or advanced symptomatic ON with secondary arthritis of the hip or knee and moderate-to-severe pain or loss of function for whom nonoperative therapy was ineffective. Radiographic severity may be measured by validated grading systems such as K/L or Tonnis (14,26).",

A Patient Panel of 8 patients, who were either candidates for or had prior TJA, was convened and moderated by a rheumatologist and ACR staff (LR, AT, RP). Patients reviewed the evidence report and provided their perspectives and preferences for consideration by the Voting Panel. The evidence was reviewed, and recommendations were formulated and voted on by an expert Voting Panel consisting of rheumatologists, orthopedic surgeons, and patients.",
            "Paragrah 3": "Consensus required ≥70% agreement on both direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation, as per ACR practice. A recommendation could be either in favor of or against the proposed intervention and either strong or conditional. According to GRADE, a recommendation was categorized as strong if the panel was very confident that the benefits of an intervention clearly outweigh the harms or burdens (or vice versa); a conditional recommendation denoted uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, such as when the evidence quality is low or very low, when the decision was sensitive to individual patient preferences, or when costs were expected to impact the decision. Thus, conditional recommendations referred to decisions in which incorporation of patient preferences was a particularly essential element of decision-making.

This does not include patients who have mild radiographic OA, patients who have minimal pain and/or disability, or patients who have not tried nonoperative therapy.

Prior to presenting to an orthopedic surgeon and being indicated for TJA, patients in the defined population have already attempted nonoperative treatment for an extended period. Further delay to TJA may lead to increased pain, loss of function, and worsening of medical comorbidities due to limited mobility. Patients may elect to delay surgery due to personal reasons (e.g., work or family obligations) or ongoing medical comorbidities that can be optimized prior to surgery. In these cases, patients may consider proceeding with nonoperative treatment (excluding intraarticular injections in some cases; see below) to provide pain relief while awaiting surgery."

While physical therapy may provide benefit in knee and hip OA (2), and physical therapy may be of benefit in anticipation of arthroplasty as a form of prerehabilitation to improve the outcome of surgery (27), delaying surgery for physical therapy may cause increased pain due to the severity of an individual’s disease (28). However, nonambulatory patients, patients recovering from medical comorbidities (e.g., stroke) that may limit their rehabilitation postoperatively, or patients who have major lower extremity muscular weakness may benefit from delaying TJA for physical therapy to help improve postoperative outcomes. This recommendation does not apply directly to prerehabilitation, such as a preoperative individualized exercise and lifestyle modification program. Observational studies provided additional evidence for prehabilitation alone and prehabilitation versus usual care for patients with knee or hip OA or knee or hip ON with secondary arthritis awaiting TKA/THA. These studies had small sample sizes and provided indirect comparisons, sometimes with lack of precision in effect estimates, so the evidence supporting the recommendation is indirect or of low quality. Moreover, the included randomized controlled trials either did not have a surgical arm or randomized patients on surgical waiting lists. The effect of physical therapy ranged from insignificant to borderline significant with small effect sizes. This recommendation is conditional because there may be exceptions to this recommendation, and the evidence supporting the recommendation is indirect and low quality.

        "Overview": "The treatment of nontraumatic osteonecrosis is controversial. If the osteonecrosis is caught in an early stage, the goal of therapy is to preserve the native joint for as long as possible. However,given that hip osteonecrosis often progresses, the mainstay of treatment is surgical using either a joint-preserving procedure, if possible,or total hip arthroplasty.",

                "Chronic"
            ],
            "SCFE Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of SCFE is usually made on plain radiographs, which reveal an apparent posterior displacement of the femoral epiphysis, like ice cream slipping off a cone.The earliest plain radiographic changes are widening and irregularity of the physis, with thinning of the proximal epiphysis. These changes are best seen on lateral views. If the radiograph is normal but suspicion for early SCFE is high, MRI may demonstrate widening of the physis with surrounding edema, essentially diagnostic of the disease.",
            "Preoperative management": "The treatment of SCFE is operative. Children with SCFE, regardless of classification, should receive prompt consultation with an orthopedic surgeon with pediatric expertise; they must avoid bearing weight until they have undergone orthopedic evaluation. Patients with acute (unstable) should undergo hospital admission for treatment by an orthopedist with pediatric expertise at initial presentation. Hospital admission and bed rest may also be necessary for patients with bilateral SCF, whether acute or chronic.",
            "Operative stabilization": "The operative goals are stabilization of the diseased physis to prevent further slippage and avoidance of complications. Surgical options are provided. Prophylactic pinning of the contralateral hip during initial stabilization of a SCFE is a consideration depending on individual patient characteristics.",
            "Measures to prevent secondary slip": "To prevent delay in diagnosis of a second slip, all patients with unilateral involvement who do not undergo prophylactic repair of the contralateral hip require close follow-up by an orthopedic surgeon until the patient reaches skeletal maturity. Patients and parents/primary caregivers should be instructed to seek medical attention immediately if they experience symptoms of SCFE (eg,nonradiating,dull,aching pain in the hip, groin,thigh, or knee)."

        "Title": "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)",
        "Author": "Lynne C Jones, PhD; Michael A Mont, MD",
        "SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS": {
            "Pathogenesis": "Osteonecrosis is associated with numerous conditions and treatments that can cause direct damage to vasculature of the bone or direct and indirect injury to the bone or bone marrow, and ultimately mechanical failure of the bone. Osteonecrosis is also termed aseptic necrosis, avascular necrosis, atraumatic necrosis, and ischemic necrosis.",
            "Risk factors": "Risk factors for osteonecrosis include traumatic injury that disrupts the arterial supply to the bone, the use of certain medications or conditions that alter perfusion through otherwise normal vessels (eg,glucocorticoids,bisphosphonates, sickle cell disease,systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE],Gaucher disease [GD] thrombophila, decompression disease), treatments that are toxic to bone marrow (eg, radiation therapy), and others that have multifactorial causes (eg, post-transplantation).",
            "Clinical features": "While any bone can be involved, certain anatomic sites are prone to osteonecrosis, including the femoral head, the knee (distal femoral and proximal tibial condyles), the humeral head, and certain bones of the foot (talus) and wrist (scaphoid). Osteonecrosis can be asymptomatic or symptomatic. Patients with symptomatic osteonecrosis typically complain of pain associated with the affected site with and without activity, which, for the extremities, may limit activities of daily living or ambulation.",
            "Diagnosis": "For symptomatic patients, the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected osteonecrosis should begin with plain radiography of the affected site. If the history and physical examination are highly suggestive and plain radiography is not diagnostic, MRI of the affected itshould be performed. MRI is highly sensitive for osteonecrosis and identifies pathologic changes earlier than other imaging modalities.",
            "Radiologic classification systems": "Several different radiologic classification and staging systems, predominantly describing osteonecrosis of the hip,have been developed to provide information on the extent of disease and risk of progression, and, thus, help guide treatment decisions.",
            "Differential diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis of osteonecrosis includes a variety of other entities that can cause bone or joint pain. Specific considerations for related but distinct entities that are considered variants of osteonecrosis, including bone marrow edema syndrome (BMES), subchondral insufficiency fracture,osteonecrosis during pregnancy, and idiopathic transient osteoporosis of the hip, are discussed above."

        "Author": "Greg A Erens, MD; Marianna Crowley, MD",
        "SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS": {
            "THA Definition": "Total hip arthroplasty (THA), also known as total hip replacement, consists of resection of the diseased articular surfaces of the hip, followed by replacement with prosthetic hip components.",
            "THA Candidacy and indications": "For the properly selected patient, the procedure results in significant pain relief as well as improved function and quality of life.THA is typically an elective procedure and should only be considered after a thorough discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives. The most common indication for THA is for the relief of pain associated with osteoarthritis of the hip in patients who have failed nonoperative treatments. Other conditions that cause pain and loss of function that may result in the need for THA include inflammatory arthritides (eg,rheumatoid arthritis,psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthropathies), femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, developmental hip dysplasia,childhood hip disorders (eg,Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis),trauma,neoplasms, and osteonecrosis.",
            "THA Contraindications": [
                "Active infection is the most significant contraindication to THA",
                "Other contraindications include preexisting or significant medical problems (eg,recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, severe anemia), skeletal immaturity,quadriplegia,or permanent or irreversible muscle weakness in the absence of pain. Relative contraindications indlude paraplegia, inabilit to ambulate that is not related to the hip disorder per se,absence of hip abductor muscle function, progressive neurologic deficit, a neuropathic (Charcot) joint, and patients with severe obesity."
            ],
            "THA Preoperative evaluation": "A careful preoperative evaluation must be performed to confirm hip pathology as the source of symptoms and disabilit, ensure the appropriateness of surgery, and assist with surgical planning. The evaluation includes particular elements of the history, a physical examination, imaging and laboratory studies, a review of treatment alternatives, and discussions of the benefits and risks of the procedure.",
            "THA Anesthesia": "THA can be performed with general anesthesia, regional anesthesia,or neuraxial lie,spinal, epidural, or combined spinal-epidural) anesthesia. The choice of anesthetic technique is based on patient comorbidities and patient choice. Spinal anesthesia may be associated with less pain and shorter hospital stays than general.",
            "Procedure": {
                "THA Perioperative care": "Prophylactic antibiotics are given preoperatively to reduce the risk for surgical site infection and prosthetic joint infection. Postoperative thromboprophylaxis should also be administered in patients undergoing THA. Prophylactic antibiotic regimens and the approach to thromboprophylaxis in adult orthopedic surgery are discussed in detail separately.(See 'Prevention of prosthetic joint and other types of orthopedic hardware infection',section on 'During hardware placement'and 'Prevention of venous thromboembolism in adults undergoing hip fracture repair or hip or knee replacement'.",
                "THA Surgical procedure": "THA is carried out in a stepwise fashion. THA can be performed using a posterolateral, direct lateral, or anterior approach and may involve computer- or robot-based assistance. Total hip prostheses consist of a femoral component, an acetabular component, and a bearing surface. There are a number of femoral and acetabular implants available for use. The choices reflect different philosophies regarding the type of fixation, design features, and materials.",
                "THA Postoperative care": "Postoperative care includes pain management and venousthromboembolism prophylaxis, as well as appropriate physical therapy exercises tosafely achieve the best and quickest return to full function. For patients at high risk of heterotopic ossification (HO), we suggest administeringprophylactic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Grade 2C). Suchpatients include those with a history of HO or ankylosing spondylitis and thosereceiving a cemented implant, bilateral surgery, or direct lateral surgical approach.Indomethacin is the most commonly used NSAID for HO prophylaxis, althoughother NSAIDs are also effective. The usual dose of indomethacin is 75 to 100 mg/dayand should be continued for 7 to 14 days postoperatively. External beam radiation isa reasonable alternative treatment for patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs or forwhom NSAIDs are contraindicated. Measures aimed at preventing HO should beadministered before the fifth postoperative day, optimally within 24 to 48 hours."
            },
            "Outcomes": "THA typically results in excellent clinical and functional outcomes.Mortality following THA is overall low, with estimates citing a 30- or 90-day mortality ofless than 1 percent, and is primarily related to preexisting medical comorbidities. Studies estimate that almost 60 percent of hip replacements last 25 years or longer. Complications following THA include those that may occur with any major surgery, suchas those related to anesthesia, blood loss, or transfusion reactions. Complications thatare specific to the hip arthroplasty procedure are discussed in detail separately."

Hip replacements usually last at least 15 years, and most last longer. How long a replacement joint lasts depends on different things, such as how active the person is.",
        "What happens during hip replacement surgery?" : "Hip replacement surgery happens in an operating room in a hospital. You will get 'anesthesia' medicines to make you sleep and to numb your body. hen, your doctor will make a cut on your outer hip and thigh.

            "Surgery on your leg or foot"
        ],
        "Purpose of crutches": "With crutches, you can move around while the injured part of your body rests and heals. They help keep you from making a fracture or sprain worse, or using your leg too much so it can't heal properly.",
        "General usage guidelines of crutches": {
            "Check crutch components": "Ensure they have a soft armrest pad and non-skid tip pad to prevent slipping and discomfort.",
            "Adjust to proper height": "The top of the crutches should be 2 finger-widths below the armpit when standing. Elbows should be slightly bent, wrists straight when holding grips.",
            "Weight distribution": "Support weight with arms and hands, not armpits, to avoid nerve damage.",
            "Practice walking technique": "Move both crutches slightly forward, then bring the 'good' leg even with the crutches, keeping balance without swinging past the crutches.",
            "Visual focus": "Look forward, not at feet, to avoid tripping.",
            "Be extra careful on stairs": {
                "Remember that the 'good' goes up and the 'bad' goes down": [
                    "When you are going up the stairs, step up with your 'good' leg first, using the crutches for balance. Then, bring the crutches up to the same step.",
                    "When going down the stairs, put the crutches 1 step below you. Then, carefully step or hop down to the same step with your 'good' leg.",
                    "Another option is to hold both crutches in 1 hand, and use the handrail for support as you carefully hop up or down the stairs. Or you can sit on the stairs and push yourself up or down while seated. This approach might be easier for children."

            "Be careful getting in and out of cars": "Fully open the car door, avoid using it for support. Adjust seat for space and seek assistance if needed.",
            "Make your home safer": "Remove tripping hazards like loose rugs, cords, and clutter.",
            "Keep your hands free": "Use a backpack or shoulder bag to keep hands free for crutch support."

        "What should I do if my crutches are causing pain?": [
            "Mild discomfort is normal; take breaks to rest tired arms/hands.",
            "Contact your doctor/nurse if pain is severe, as crutch height may need adjustment."
        ],
        "When can I stop using my crutches?": "It depends on the injury or surgery you had, and how quickly your body heals. Your doctor or nurse will talk to you about how long you should keep using crutches. They might also do a follow-up exam, or imaging tests such as X-rays, to see how you are healing.",
        "What if I can't use crutches?": [
            "Inability to use crutches if both legs are injured, or if there's an arm injury",
            "Children under 6 may struggle with safe usage",
            "If you can't use crutches, you might need to use a wheelchair while you heal. In some situations, a walker or special scooter might also be an option. "
